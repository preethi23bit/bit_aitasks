Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning technique widely used in data analysis and statistics. It is designed to predict continuous numeric outputs based on one or more input features. The method tries to understand how the dependent variable changes when independent variables vary. It assumes that the relationship between inputs and output follows a straight-line pattern. Mathematically, the model expresses the output as a weighted sum of input features along with a bias term. During training, the algorithm learns optimal weight and bias values by reducing the difference between predicted results and true values. This difference is commonly measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function. Linear Regression relies on assumptions such as constant variance of errors, independence of observations, and normally distributed residuals. It is computationally efficient, easy to understand, and highly interpretable. Typical use cases include predicting property prices, estimating income, analyzing trends, and forecasting sales. However, the model is highly affected by outliers and is not suitable for problems with complex non-linear relationships.

Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks, especially those involving two classes. Even though it contains the word “regression,” it is not intended for predicting continuous values. Instead, it estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific category. The algorithm first forms a linear combination of input features and then applies the sigmoid function, which transforms the result into a value between 0 and 1. Based on a chosen threshold (commonly 0.5), the probability is converted into a class label. Logistic Regression is trained using the binary cross-entropy (log loss) function, which penalizes incorrect probability predictions. While the model does not require a linear relationship between inputs and output classes, it assumes a linear relationship between features and the log-odds of the target. It is efficient, interpretable, and performs well on linearly separable data. Common applications include email spam filtering, disease prediction, fraud detection, and credit risk analysis. Multiclass problems can also be handled using extensions like One-vs-Rest or Softmax.
