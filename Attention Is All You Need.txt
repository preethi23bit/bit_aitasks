Attention Is All You Need

“Attention Is All You Need” is a research paper published by Google in 2017.
The paper introduces the Transformer model, which is a new architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
Unlike earlier models, it does not use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
The Transformer relies entirely on an attention mechanism to process input data.
Attention helps the model focus on important words in a sentence while processing information.
The model uses self-attention to understand relationships between words in the same sentence.
The Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder structure.
The encoder processes the input sequence, while the decoder generates the output sequence.
Each encoder and decoder layer contains multi-head attention and feed-forward neural networks.
Multi-head attention allows the model to learn different types of relationships simultaneously.
The model uses positional encoding to retain the order of words in a sentence.
Transformers enable parallel processing, making training faster than RNN-based models.
The architecture achieved better performance in machine translation tasks.
The model became the foundation for modern NLP systems like BERT and GPT.
Overall, the paper changed the way natural language processing models are designed.
